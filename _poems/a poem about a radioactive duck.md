there once was a duck,
whose nickname was sneaky snuck.
on the far lands went snuck,
to see all about the bluff.

suddenly he sees a corn,
and quietly he starts to mourn.

come one bruv, breath,
it won't take a part of me,
it's not what you need,
you're not that mean.

yummy,
says snuck.
it tastes just like a gummy,
oh, yes, I am in luck.

soon he passes out,
and ka-boom explodes Chernobyl loud.

he wakes up,
to see hes outlived the exploding 
nut.

and from now on,
says the law,
sneaky snuck,
will be know as the radioactive duck.
