bullet, skull, pain, death penalty  
the sudden sting is poking my heart.  
it all starts to seem like a comedy  
and everything around me becomes dark  
  
mesmerize and hypnotize the inner darkness  
and make it be the brightest thing around  
but why should I obey this absurdness  
so I can just feel even more drown?  
  
they say "be happy and just smile"  
although they can never imagine my pain  
please understand - this is not a lifestyle  
let me scream standing in the pouring rain  
  
lingering shadows enter the back of my mind  
internal echoes in my mind are one of a kind  
fading feelings and my depression combined  
emptiness is the reason I became so blind
