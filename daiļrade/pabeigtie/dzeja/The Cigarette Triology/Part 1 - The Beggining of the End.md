The smoke that rises from the ash,
A habit that’s hard to smash,
A vice that's quick to grasp,
A craving strong enough to clasp.

The cigarette burns bright and true,
A spark that brings a feeling new,
A thrill that's hard to undo,
A fire that starts with every cue.

The addiction takes its place,
A pull that’s hard to displace,
A hold that seems to embrace,
A shadow no one wants to face.

The smoke begins to cloud the air,
A scent that clings without a care,
A path that’s hard to declare,
A road that leads to dark despair.

The cigarette, a silent curse,
A habit sinking deeper, worse,
A lure that feels like universe,
A craving bound to soon immerse.
