The love of his life was the cigarette,
A passion that he couldn’t forget,
In each drag, he’d feel alive,
Addiction his reason to strive.

He’d feel its warmth, the smoke’s embrace,
A comfort he thought he couldn’t replace,
As years passed, the toll grew clear,
But he clung tight, despite the fear.

He fought to break free from its spell,
Wrestling with the depths of its hell,
Yearning for love that wouldn’t harm,
For peace and health, a life of calm.

Though letting go felt like a loss,
He knew his life was worth the cost.
With each small step, he’d redefine,
A love for life that wasn’t confined.

For the cigarette, his heart did grieve,
But slowly, he learned how to believe,
In a life that felt whole and bright,
A reason to live, to reach the light.
