He lit his first cigarette when he was just fifteen,
A rebel move to join the scene,
Ignoring the coughs, the stains, the signs,
Feeling cool with each smoky line.

He carried on through college days,
Ignoring whispers of health decay,
Telling himself he could always quit,
Though deep down, he questioned it.

He met someone who begged him to change,
But addiction’s grip was hard to exchange,
He found his reasons, night and day,
To keep his stress and fears at bay.

But in time, he lost her, then his pride,
And felt the darkness grow inside.
A doctor’s words confirmed his fate,
A moment too late to liberate.

He smoked his last upon his bed,
Regretful for the words unsaid,
And with his final breath and choke,
Left behind memories in smoke.
