Even birds are caged to the sky,
As even humans are bound to lie.
The thought of freedom makes us fly,
Yet chains are too strong to defy.

The concept itself is hard to breach,
Everything is out of reach.
Society tries, again, to teach - 
Leaving us with muffled speech.

Lonely screams begin to sprout,
Your mind starts filling with doubt.
Let us find a different route,
Now's the time to scout.

The walls around begin to close,
Built from fears that no one knows.
Dreams like rivers, forced to freeze,
Hope held captive, longing for release.

A spark ignites within the heart,
A whispered call, a restless start.
What if chains are meant to break,
If courage is all it would take?

Dare we risk the fall to fly,
To rise beyond, reach past the sky?
For in the breaking, we might find
A world unchained, a freed mind.
