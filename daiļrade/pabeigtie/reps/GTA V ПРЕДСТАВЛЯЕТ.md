this story comes from the land of Imanta,
about a little boy who looks like a branta.
man's face was dead, man's hair was red,
friends they say - man's stumped in the head.
his everyday includes vodka and nicotine,
life - his misery will be ended by guillotine.
the place of his dreams was the local slut house,
the man of his dreams was the beloved Richard Strauss.

Gta, gta, we gotta talk

now the man goes online, sweating and flexin,
all of the kids online allways be fuckin wexin.
he fucks up the cops, their moms, their wifes,
without remorse fucking their miserable lifes.
driving in the bmw spiting at their fucking face,
horns blasting, alarms glistening, begins the chase.

GTA, seriously, we gotta talk

in the wild shadows, spawns a wrecked man,
with a lift of his finger he snapped and formed a klan.
going by the name "Mr. Piepulin" always movin',
shooting the masses, making a point, always provin'.
proving a point of being the unwanted bastard child,
from the home country and his own mind exiled.
pressing the tab, scrolling the wheel, just assume,
pulling the pin, being the sin, becoming the boom.

GTA, fo fucks sake, man.
