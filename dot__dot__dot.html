            <p>Even birds are caged to the sky,<br />
As even humans are bound to lie.<br />
The thought of freedom makes us fly,<br />
Yet chains are too strong to defy.</p>

<p>The concept itself is hard to breach,<br />
Everything is out of reach.<br />
Society tries, again, to teach -<br />
Leaving us with muffled speech.</p>

<p>Lonely screams begin to sprout,<br />
Your mind starts filling with doubt.<br />
Let us find a different route,<br />
Now's the time to scout.</p>

<p>The walls around begin to close,<br />
Built from fears that no one knows.<br />
Dreams like rivers, forced to freeze,<br />
Hope held captive, longing for release.</p>

<p>A spark ignites within the heart,<br />
A whispered call, a restless start.<br />
What if chains are meant to break,<br />
If courage is all it would take?</p>

<p>Dare we risk the fall to fly,<br />
To rise beyond, reach past the sky?<br />
For in the breaking, we might find<br />
A world unchained, a freed mind.</p>
