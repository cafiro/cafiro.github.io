        <h1 class="poem-title">a poem about a radioactive duck</h1>
        <div class="poem-body">
            <p>there once was a duck,<br />
whose nickname was sneaky snuck.<br />
on the far lands went snuck,<br />
to see all about the bluff.</p>

<p>suddenly he sees a corn,<br />
and quietly he starts to mourn.</p>

<p>come one bruv, breath,<br />
it won't take a part of me,<br />
it's not what you need,<br />
you're not that mean.</p>

<p>yummy,<br />
says snuck.<br />
it tastes just like a gummy,<br />
oh, yes, I am in luck.</p>

<p>soon he passes out,<br />
and ka-boom explodes Chernobyl loud.</p>

<p>he wakes up,<br />
to see hes outlived the exploding<br />
nut.</p>

<p>and from now on,<br />
says the law,<br />
sneaky snuck,<br />
will be know as the radioactive duck.</p>
